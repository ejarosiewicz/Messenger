# Messenger
A simple messaging app written for the purposes of my diploma thesis named: "Creating complex applications for tablets with Android system". User can log inho their own account, read messages, and send message into another person, which has an account in the server. Actually application is connected by mockup of server, because I had no time to write my own backend - maybe it will be done in the future :) 

Now I'm working at refactoring, because project was written in a short period of time, and it contains some bugs and unclear parts of code. See "code-refactoring" branch for result.

Refactoring is temporarily abandoned, because I would like to start another projects
